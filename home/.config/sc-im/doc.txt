Commands for handling cell content:
     x , dd      Deletes the current selected cell or range and save its content in yankbuffer
     m           Followed by any lowercase letter, marks the current cell or the selected range with that letter.
                 NOTE: When a mark is changed, all ranges that use that mark are deleted.
     c           Copy a marked cell to the current cell, adjusting row and column references in its numeric or string expression, if any.
     R           Followed by two lowercase letters that represent marks of cell, creates a range using those marks and selects it.
                 NOTE: If a range already exists, its replaced with new values.
     { } |       align the content of a cell to the left, right or to center. if a range is selected,
                 every cell of the range gets aligned.

     f- , fj , f-DOWN:       Change cell format: Decrease decimal precision.
     f< , fh , f-LEFT:       Change cell format: Decrease column width.
     f> , fl , f-RIGHT:      Change cell format: Incrementa column width.
     ir          inserts a row
     ic          inserts a column

     yc          yanks current column

     p           pastes previous yanked cell/s or range
                 if yr was used to yank a row, 'p' creates a new row below, and paste content there.
                 if yc was used to yank a column, 'p' creates a new col at the left of curcol, and paste content there.
     Pf          works like p command except that only cell formatting information is merged in, leaving the actual data untouched.
     Pv          works like p command except that only cell values are copied, leaving cell format intact.
     Pc          works like p command except that all cell references are adjusted in the same way that they are for the copy command.

     t           same as 'p' command but if yr was used to yank a row, it creates a new row above, and paste content there.
                 if yc was used to yank a column, this command creates a new col at the right, and paste there.
     Tf          works like t command except that only cell formatting information is merged in, leaving the actual data untouched.
     Tv          works like t command except that only cell values are copied, leaving cell format intact.
     Tc          works like t command except that all cell references are adjusted in the same way that they are for the copy command.

                 14. lock and unlock of cells
                 15. datefmt command

     c-d         converts text content of a selected cell or range to a date, using default LOCALE's D_FMT format.
                 This converts text content to a numeric value that can shown as a date. See DATE INPUT below for more info.
                 NOTE: USELOCALE has to be enabled during build.


 Other commands:
     ^L          Redraw the screen
     Zr          zap (hide) current row
     Zc          zap (hide) current column
     Sr          if a range is selected, it shows the rows hidden inside the range
     Sc          if a range is selected, it shows the cols hidden inside the range
     '/'         is an alias for ':int goto '.
                 If a number is given, SCIM will search for a cell containing that number. Searches for either strings or numbers proceed forward from the current cell, wrapping back to a0 at the end of the table, and terminate at the current cell if the string or number is not found.
                 Ex.: You can type '/4' to look for cells that has the value of 4.
                 Or you can type '/value' to look for cells that has "value" as label content.
                 You can also quote a regular expression, and SCIM will search for a cell containing a string matching the regular expression.
                 You can also search formatted numbers or expressions using regular expressions by preceding the opening quotes of the regular expression with a '#' (for formatted numbers) or a '%' (for expressions).
                 These are handy for searching for dates within a specified range or cells which reference a given cell, for example, although they are somewhat slower than searching through ordinary strings, since all numbers must be formatted or expressions decompiled on the fly during the search.

     rl          Use this command to lock the current cell or a range of cells, i.e. make them immune to any type of editing. A locked cell can't be changed in any way until it is unlocked.
     ru          This command is the opposite of the rl command and thus unlocks a locked cell and makes it editable.
     rv          valueize area: remove expressions from the affected range leaving only the values.
     c-j         auto resize column width to fit its contents.

     :format "string"
           sets current cell format (or cells format of a selected range).
           string parameter contains the format to use to convert the number,
           and can be one or more of these:
 
           #    Digit placeholder.  If the number has fewer digits on either
                side of the decimal point than  there are '#' characters in
                the format, the extra '#' characters are ignored.  The number
                is rounded to the number of digit placeholders as there are
                to the right of the decimal point.  If there are more digits
                in the number than there are digit placeholders on the left
                side of the decimal point, then those digits are displayed.

           0    Digit placeholder.  Same as for '#' except that the number
                is padded with zeroes on either side of the decimal point.
                The number of zeroes used in padding is determined by the
                number of digit placeholders after the '0' for digits on
                the left side of the decimal point and by the number of
                digit placeholders before the '0' for digits on the right
                side of the decimal point.

           .    Decimal point.  Determines how many digits are placed on
                the right and left sides of the decimal point in the number.
                Note that numbers smaller than 1 will begin with a decimal
                point if the left side of the decimal point contains only
                a '#' digit placeholder.  Use a '0' placeholder to get a
                leading zero in decimal formats.

           %    Percentage.  For each '%' character in the format, the actual
                number gets multiplied by 100 (only for purposes of formatting
                -- the original number is left unmodified) and the '%' character
                is placed in the same position as it is in the format.

           ,    Thousands separator.  The presence of a ',' in the format
                (multiple commas are treated as one) will cause the number
                to be formatted with a ',' separating each set of three digits
                in the integer part of the number with numbering beginning
                from the right end of the integer.

           d    its used to specify a date format that is applied to the numeric
                value of a cell. (See also the DATE INPUT section below)
                Date format strings are identified by the presence of a 'd'
                in the first position. If this is present, the
                remainder of the string is passed to the strftime() function,
                and therefore uses the same conversion specifiers as strftime().
                For more information on conversion specifiers for date format
                strings, see the man page for strftime(3).

           E- E+ e- e+
                Scientific format.  Causes the number to formatted in scientific
                notation. The case of the 'E' or 'e' given is preserved. If
                the format uses a '+', then the sign is always given for the
                exponent value. If the format uses a '-', then the sign is
                only given when the exponent value is negative. Note that if
                there is no digit placeholder following the '+' or '-', then
                that part of the formatted number is left out. In general,
                there should be one or more digit placeholders after the '+'
                or '-'.

           examples:     :format "###,###,000"
                         :format "d%d/%m/%Y"
                         :format "####.####E+3"


    :datefmt string   See DATE INPUT section below


    :sort range string
                sort a range of cells with a given criteria.
                The rows in the specified range will be sorted according
                to a criteria given in the form of a string of characters.
                This string, enclosed in double quotes, may comprise a
                single criterion or multiple criteria in decreasing order
                of precedence. Each criterion has three parts, all of which are mandatory.
                The first part is a single character, which must be either + or - , which specifies
                whether the sort should be done in ascending or descending order, respectively.
                The second part, which is also a single character, must be either # or $ ,
                and is used to specify whether the sort should be based
                on the numeric portion or the string portion, respectively,
                of the cells being used for the comparison.
                The third part may be either one or two characters, and
                must be alphabetic (case insensitive), and specifies
                the column to be used when making the comparisons.
                This column must be in the range being sorted.
                Any number of criteria may be concatenated using ';', and will be used
                in the order specified.

                examples:        :sort C10:E13 "+#D"
                                 :sort C10:E13 "+#C;-#D"

    :sort string
                save as the previous but sort is done over a selected range



    :addfilter
    :filteron
    :filteroff
    :delfilter
    :delfilters
                These commands are used to filter a range of rows by multiple criteria.

                To apply a filter over a range first is neccesary to add a filter criteria.
                To define a criteria you have to use the addfilter command, with this format:

                The first part, is a single character, which must be either # or $, and is used to specify whether the expression evaluates
                over the numeric portion or the string portion of the cell, respectively,",
                The second part is a column name where its values are evaluated with an expression.
                The third part is actually the expression used for the evalutation.
                Multiple criteria can be specified separating them with the ';' character.

                These are some examples:
                            :addfilter "#B<8000"
                            :addfilter "#C>1500"
                            :addfilter "@eqs(@substr($B,1,3),'SEP')"
                            :addfilter "#B>3000;#B<5000;#B>@avg(B1:B20)"

                Once filters are added, you can see the details of each filter with :showfilters special command.
                Each filter is preceded by a number. You can delete a filter typing :delfilter NUMBER. In this
                example, the first filter defined is removed:
                            :delfilter 0

                To delete all defined filters, it can be used the :delfilters special command.

                You can apply those filters to a range with the :filteron special command.
                Ex.:        :filteron B10:C13
    
                If a range is already selected you can simply type :filteron

                To turn off the filters you can type:
                            :filteroff


    :int string
                sends a command to the interpreter
                example:          :int goto B2


    :hidecol C  
                hide column C

    :hiderow 4 
                hide row 4

    :showcol C 
                show column C that was previously hidden

    :showrow 5
                show row 5 that was previously hidden

    :hidecol A:C
                hide a range of columns

    :hiderow 4:8
                hide a range of rows

                show a range of rows that were previously hidden

    :showrows  
                if a range is selected, this command shows the rows hidden that are covered by the range


    :hiddenrows
                show details of hidden rows

    :hiddencols
                show details of hidden cols

    :color <str>
                changes a color definition.
                example of use:  :color type=HEADINGS bold=0 fg=BLACK bg=YELLOW
                color parameters have to be one of the following:
                     type, fg, bg, bold, dim, reverse, standout, underline, blink.
                the first three are mandatory
                type has to be one of the following:
                     HEADINGS, MODE, NUMB, STRG, DATEF, EXPRESSION, CELL_ERROR,
                     CELL_NEGATIVE, CELL_SELECTION, CELL_SELECTION_SC,
                     INFO_MSG, ERROR_MSG, CELL_ID, CELL_FORMAT,
                     CELL_CONTENT, WELCOME, NORMAL, INPUT.
                fg and bg have to be one of the following: WHITE, BLACK, RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, MAGENTA, CYAN.
                other parameters are booleans and its values have to be 1 or 0.
                Instead of modifing a color at runtime, colors can be specified in:
                     a. the .scimrc file stored in your $HOME variable
                     b. in current .sc file.
                The format is similar:
                Ex.: color "type=HEADINGS fg=BLACK bg=YELLOW bold=0"

    :lock       Use this command to lock the current cell or a range of cells, i.e. make them immune to any type of editing. A locked cell can't be changed in any way until it is unlocked.

    :unlock     This command is the opposite of the :lock command and thus unlocks a locked cell and makes it editable.

    :valueize   valueize area: remove expressions from the affected range leaving only the values.

    :! cmd      executes command 'cmd' in shell

    :autojus A:D   
                auto resize columns A to D, to fit its contents.

    :autojus    same as previous command, but the columns resized are the columns represented by the selected cell or range.

    c-r {char}  Being {char} a mark of a cell or range, the range represented by that char gets inserted in the command line

    commandline history is stored in $HOME/.sciminfo
    c-p         goes back in command line history
    c-n         goes forward in command line history
    <UP>        goes back in command line history
    <DOWN>      goes forward in command line history



 *VISUAL MODE*
    This mode is used for selecting a range of cells to do an operation
    At entering to this mode, top left limit of the selected range, and the bottom right limit is set to
    current row and column.
    The following movements commands helps to complete a selection in different ways.
    j k l h     Move cursor down, up, right or left
    0           Moves to column A
    $           Moves forward to the last valid column of the current row.
    #           Moves down to the last valid row of the current column.
    ^           Moves up to row 0 of the current column.
    'a          Moves to cell or select range marked previously as c.
                See the m command for details.
    c-f c-b     Increase selection down or up a full screen.
                set variable half_page_scroll to 1 to scroll half a page, instead of full page. see :set command for details.
    c-a         Moves to first cell of spreadsheet.

    y           yanks selected cell or range and exit VISUAL MODE.
    x , dd      Deletes the current range and save its content in yankbuffer
    H           Moves to to first row seen on screen.
    L           Moves to last row seen on screen.
    M           Moves to middle row seen on screen.
    w           Moves forward to the next valid cell.
    b           Moves back to the previous valid cell.
    G           Moves to last valid cell of spreadsheet.

    :           Enters COMMAND MODE preserving the range selection, so a special command can be entered.
    Zr          Zaps (hides) the rows covered by the selected range.
    Zc          Zaps (hides) the columns covered by the selected range.
    Sr          Shows rows that are hidden and that get covered by the selected range.
    Sc          Shows columns that are hidden and that get covered by the selected range.
    { } |       Aligns the content of the cells covered by the selected range, to right, left or to center.
    rl          Use this command to lock the current cell or a range of cells, i.e. make them immune to any type of editing. A locked cell can't be changed in any way until it is unlocked.
    ru          This command is the opposite of the rl command and thus unlocks a locked cell and makes it editable.
    rv          valueize area: remove expressions from the affected range leaving only the values.
    m           Followed by any lowercase letter, marks the selected range with that letter.
                NOTE: When a mark is changed, all ranges that use that mark are deleted.
    c-d         converts text content of the selected range to a date, using default LOCALE's D_FMT format.
                This converts text content to a numeric value that can shown as a date. See DATE INPUT below for more info.
                NOTE: USELOCALE has to be enabled during build.
    c-j         auto resize column width to fit its contents.

*MAPPING*
    mapping can be done in any SCIM file or in .scimrc file in current home directory.
    maps can be added with nmap and imap commands, and they can be removed with
    nunmap, iunmap commands
    ex.:
        nmap "d" ":h<cr>"     ->   d maps to ':help<cr>' in normal mode
        imap "f" "foo"     ->   f maps to 'foo' string in insert mode

    Some notes:
    Left and Right sequence of a mapping cannot contain numbers.
    <ESC> key cannot be mapped. But other special keys can.
    Those keys are <CR> <C-x> <TAB> <LEFT> <RIGHT> <DOWN> <UP> <DEL> <BS> <HOME> <END> <PGDOWN> <PGUP>
    If a map sequence that exists is re-mapped, it gets replaced with the new one.
    Mapping is recursive by default. The non recursive versions of nmap and imap are
    the nnoremap and inoremap commands. An example of use:
        nmap "a" "b",
        nnoremap "b" "j"
        nmap "j" ":h<cr>"
    with this, 'a' maps to 'j', and only 'j' maps to ':h<cr>'


*COMMAND MULTIPLIER*
    Commands in NORMAL MODE, VISUAL MODE or EDIT MODE can be multiplied if a number is previously typed.
    Ex. '4j' in NORMAL MODE, translates to 4 times 'j'.
    Ex. '4yr' in NORMAL MODE, yanks current row and the 3 rows below it.
    NOTE: the 'x' command in VISUAL MODE and shift commands in VISUAL MODE and NORMAL MODE, when a range is
    selected, cannot be multiplied.


*DATES INPUT*
    Dates are internally stored in SCIM as numeric values, and they are visually
    seen as dates if a date format is applied to the cells that stores them.
    They can be entered as a label and then use the :datefmt special command to
    convert it to a numeric value and apply a format.
    Other option is to enter the numeric value and apply a format with the
    :format special command.

    The :datefmt command takes the cell's text content that represents a date,
    and uses a given format to set the numeric value of the cell.
    Its format is ':datefmt "format"', being format a strftime compatible one.
    This command then aplies that format to the cell (as it could be done with
    the :format function) so that it can be visually seen as a date.

    example:      :datefmt "%d/%m/%Y"

    C-d command can be used in NORMAL and VISUAL modes, and acts as the datefmt described above,
    but considering locale's D_FMT format.


*Other configuration variables*
    - autocalc
    set variable 'autocalc' to recalculate automatically, or set it to '0' to do it manually upon execution of '@' command

    - numeric
    setting variable 'numeric' to '1', a digit starts a numeric value
    setting the variable to '0', a digit acts as a command multiplier

    - newline_action
    set variable 'newline_action' to 'j' to move cursor down after an entry.
    set it to 'l' to move it right, or set it to '0' to expect no action.

    - external_functions
    disabled by default, set this variable to enable external functions. see @ext function below.

        Round e to the nearest integer. default: *.5 will be rounded up to the next integer;

    @round(e,n)
        Round e to n decimal places.  n may be positive to round off the right side of the decimal or nega‐
        tive to round off the left side.  See @rnd(e) above for rounding types.

        Convert string expression se to a numeric value.

    @nval(se,e)
        Return the numeric value of a cell selected by name. String expression se must evaluate to a
        column  name ("A" - "ZZ") and e must evaluate to a row number (0 - maxrows, by default 65536).
        If se or e is out of bounds, or the cell has no numeric value, the result is 0.
        You can use this for simple table lookups. See also @sval() below.

    @eqs(se1,se2)     Return 1 if string expression se1 has the same value as string expression se2, 0 otherwise.

    @slen(se)
        Returns the length of string expression se.

*String Expressions*
    String expressions are made up of constant strings (characters surrounded by double quotation marks), variables (cell
    names, which refer to the cells's label strings or expressions), and string functions.

    IMPORTANT: PLEASE NOTE THAT STRING EXPRESSIONS ARE ONLY ALLOWED WHEN ENTERING A CELL'S LABEL STRING.
               NOT ITS NUMERIC PART.
               THEY ARE ENTERED WITH A BACKSLASH FOLLOWED BY A DOUBLE QUOTE:
               Ex.:   \"@coltoa(4)
               Ex.:   \"A0 # "Plate"

    Also note that string expression results
    may be left or right flushed or centered, according to the type of the cell's string label.

    #      Concatenate strings.  For example, the string expression

               A0 # "zy dog"

           displays the string ``the lazy dog'' in the cell if the value of A0's string is ``the la''.

*Built-in String Functions*
    @substr(se,e1,e2)
        Extract and return from string expression se the substring indexed by character number  e1  through
        character  number e2 (defaults to the size of se if beyond the end of it).  If e1 is less than 1 or
        greater than e2, the result is the null string.  For example,
        
        @substr ("River Plate", 4, 8)

        returns the string 'er Pl'.

    @upper(se)
    @lower(se)
        will case the string expression to upper or lower.

    @capital(se)
        will  convert the first letter of words in a string into upper case and other letters to lower case
        (the latter if all letters of the string are upper case).

    @ext(se,e)
        Call an external function (program or script).  The purpose is to allow arbitrary functions on val‐
        ues,  e.g.  table lookups and interpolations.  String expression se is a command or command line to
        call with popen(3).  The value of e is converted to a string and appended to the command line as an
        argument.   The result of @ext() is a string: the first line printed to standard output by the com‐
        mand.  The command should emit exactly one output line.  Additional output, or output  to  standard
        error,  messes  up  the  screen.  @ext() returns a null string and prints an appropriate warning if
        external functions are disabled, se is null, or the attempt to run the command fails.

        External functions can be slow to run, and if enabled are called at each screen update, so they are
        disabled by default. Use the set command to enable it, when you really want them called.

        A simple example:
            @ext ("echo", a1)

            You can use @ston() to convert the @ext() result back to a number.  For example:
            @ston (@ext ("form.sc.ext", a9 + b9))

        Note  that  you  can build a command line (including more argument values) from a string expression
        with concatenation.  You can also "hide" the second argument by  ending  the  command  line  (first
        argument) with `` #'' (shell comment).

    @coltoa(e)
        Returns a string name for a column from the numeric argument.  For example:

            @coltoa(@mycol-1)      @nval(coltoa(@mycol-1), @myrow+1)

    @sval(se,e) 
        Return the string value of a cell selected by name.  String expression se must evaluate to a column
        name  (``A''-``AE'')  and e must evaluate to a row number (0-199).  If se or e is out of bounds, or
        the cell has no string value, the result is the null string.

*Built-in Date and Time Functions*

    @year(e)
        Return the year. Valid years begin with 1970, although many systems will return years prior to
        1970 if e is negative. The last legal year is system dependent.

    @month(e) 
        Return the month, encoded as 1 (January) to 12 (December).

    @day(e)
        Return the day of the month, encoded as 1 to 31.

    @hour(e)
